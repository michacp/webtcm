                <p>
                  <strong>Suggested text: </strong>Articles on this site may
                  include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles,
                  etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the
                  exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other
                  website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed
                  additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction
                  with that embedded content, including tracking your
                  interaction with the embedded content if you have an account
                  and are logged in to that website.
                </p>
                <h5><strong>Who we share your data with</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  <strong>Suggested text: </strong>If you request a password
                  reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.
                </p>
                <h5><strong>How long we retain your data</strong></h5>
                <p>
                  <strong>Suggested text: </strong> If you leave a comment, the
                  comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so
                  we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments
                  automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For users that register on our website (if any), we also store
                  the personal information they provide in their user profile.
                  All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information
                  at any time (except they cannot change their username).
                  Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

                  this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive
                  an exported file of the personal data we hold about you,
                  including any data you have provided to us. You can also
                  request that we erase any personal data we hold about you.

                  administrative, legal, or security purposes.
